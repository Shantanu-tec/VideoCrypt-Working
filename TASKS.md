# Tasks & Working Memory

## Last Session Snapshot
_Session 23 — 2026-03-20: Release AAR built and verified. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_AAR location: `EducryptMediaSdk/build/outputs/aar/EducryptMediaSdk-release.aar`_
_consumer-rules.pro verified complete — all public classes covered. proguard.txt confirmed non-empty inside AAR. consumerProguardFiles confirmed set in build.gradle.kts._
_Required client transitive dependency versions: `io.realm.kotlin:library-base:3.0.0`, `androidx.media3:*:1.4.1`, `androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.0`._
_No warnings in SDK build. Five pre-existing deprecation warnings in app module (systemUiVisibility in PlayerActivity.kt — unrelated to this session)._

_Session 22 — 2026-03-20: Download pause/resume bug fixed. `EducryptMedia.kt` only. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_Bug 1 fixed: `pauseDownload()` now calls `DownloadProgressManager.updateProgress(vdcId, currentProgress.copy(status = DownloadStatus.PAUSED))` after `cancelWorkerForVdcId()`. Previously the in-memory `activeDownloads` map was never cleared on pause, so `isDownloadActive(vdcId)` returned true for paused downloads, blocking `resumeDownload()` with "already in progress"._
_Bug 2 fixed: `downloadDao.updateStatus(vdcId, "Paused")` replaced with `downloadDao.updateStatus(vdcId, DownloadStatus.PAUSED)`. The raw `"Paused"` (capital P) did not equal `DownloadStatus.PAUSED = "paused"`, causing any Realm status check using the constant to silently fail._
_Also fixed: `getVideoStatusByVdcId()` line 1148 — removed redundant `status == "downloaded"` raw string (identical to `DownloadStatus.DOWNLOADED`); replaced with `status == DownloadStatus.DOWNLOADED` only._
_Added import: `com.appsquadz.educryptmedia.downloads.DownloadProgress` to `EducryptMedia.kt`._
_Up next: ship AAR to client, monitor `DownloadPaused`/`NetworkRestored` events in production logs._

_Session 20 — 2026-03-20: `PlayerMetaSnapshot` + `NetworkMetaSnapshot` events added. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_New file: `player/MetaSnapshotBuilder.kt` — internal singleton; builds and emits both snapshots. Reads active video track from ExoPlayer (height/width/bitrate/mimeType), reads network state (ConnectivityManager/TelephonyManager). All restricted API calls wrapped in try/catch → "UNKNOWN" fallback. No new permissions declared._
_New events: `EducryptEvent.PlayerMetaSnapshot` (videoId, videoUrl, isDrm, isLive, resolution, bitrate, mimeType, trigger) and `EducryptEvent.NetworkMetaSnapshot` (transport, operator, generation, isMetered, isRoaming, bandwidth, signal). Both PUBLIC — clients collect via `events.collect`._
_Emit triggers: LOADING (after initPlayer in load()), DRM_READY (end of initializeDrmPlayback), READY (end of initializeNonDrmPlayback), ERROR (EducryptPlayerListener.onPlayerError via onEmitSnapshot callback), STALL_RECOVERY (onStallDetected in initPlayer), NETWORK_RECOVERY (attemptPlaybackRecovery, both src and item branches)._
_`currentVideoId: String` and `isDrmPlayback: Boolean` added to EducryptMedia — reset in releasePlayer() (NOT setValuesToDefault(), to survive internal setValuesToDefault() calls inside init functions). Set in load() after releasePlayer()/initPlayer()._
_`EducryptPlayerListener` gained `onEmitSnapshot: ((trigger: String) -> Unit)?` parameter — invoked after ErrorOccurred in onPlayerError()._
_consumer-rules.pro: EducryptEvent$* wildcard already covers both new subtypes — no new rules needed._

_Session 19b — 2026-03-19: Network recovery position restore + memory leak audit. `EducryptMedia.kt` only. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_Memory leaks: none found. `applicationContext` used throughout. `networkCallback` unregistered in all exit paths (`releasePlayer`, `setValuesToDefault`, successful recovery). Lambda closure over singleton — no Activity/Fragment leak possible._
_Position restore: `onFatalPlaybackError()` now captures `player.currentPosition` before starting the watch (ExoPlayer retains last valid position in ERROR/IDLE state). `attemptPlaybackRecovery(resumePositionMs)` uses `setMediaSource(src, resumePositionMs)` / `setMediaItem(item, resumePositionMs)` overloads. Live streams use `resumePositionMs = 0` — ExoPlayer joins the live edge._

_Session 19 — 2026-03-19: Network recovery bug fix. `NetworkRecoveryManager.kt` only. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_Bug 1 fixed: `onAvailable()` emptied — `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED` is not present at `onAvailable()` time. Recovery trigger moved to `onCapabilitiesChanged()` where VALIDATED is present after Android's internet probe completes._
_Bug 2 fixed: callback captured in local `pendingCallback` before `stopWatching()` is called. `stopWatching()` nulls `onNetworkRestored` field; local var preserves the reference. `pendingCallback?.invoke()` now always fires._
_Expected log after fix: `[ERROR] NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE → ... → [NETWORK] restored — attempting playback recovery → playback auto-resumes._

_Session 18 — 2026-03-19: Automatic network recovery implemented. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_New: `player/NetworkRecoveryManager.kt` — `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` watches for validated network after fatal error. One-shot (stops after first restoration). Stopped on `stop()`, `shutdown()`, and new playback start._
_`EducryptEvent.NetworkRestored` — `object` subtype added (no data — pure signal). Emitted before recovery callback fires._
_`EducryptPlayerListener` — added `onFatalError: (() -> Unit)?` param; invoked when error code is `NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE`, `NETWORK_TIMEOUT`, or `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`. DRM/decoder/auth errors excluded to prevent immediate re-error loop._
_`EducryptMedia` — `networkRecoveryManager` lazy property; `onFatalPlaybackError()` starts watch (guards: hasMedia, isWatching); `attemptPlaybackRecovery()` calls `prepare() + playWhenReady` on main thread via `EducryptLifecycleManager.scope()`; `releasePlayer()` and `setValuesToDefault()` call `stopWatching()`._
_`BaseApp` — `NetworkRestored` branch at `Log.i`._
_`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission already in SDK manifest — no change needed._

_Session 17 — 2026-03-19: ABR quality fixes. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_Fix 1: `EducryptPlayerListener.onTracksChanged` — removed `QualityChanged` emission (was source of `0p→0p reason=`). During track transitions ExoPlayer reports `format.height = 0`; emitting there produced invalid events. `QualityChanged` is now `EducryptAbrController`'s sole responsibility._
_Fix 2: `EducryptAbrController.applyQuality()` — replaced `setMaxVideoSize` with `TrackSelectionOverride`. `setMaxVideoSize` sets a ceiling; ExoPlayer's internal ABR still runs within it. `TrackSelectionOverride` forces the exact track. Fallback to height cap when exact height not in current tracks. `restoreAutoSelection()` calls `clearOverridesOfType(C.TRACK_TYPE_VIDEO)`._
_Fix 3: `onTracksAvailable()` — `tracksInitialized = true` moved after `getAvailableVideoHeights()` check. If heights are empty (unresolved tracks), skips initialization and retries on next `onTracksChanged`._
_Fix 4: `QualityChanged` emission moved into `applyQuality()`. `fromHeight` captured before `currentQualityIndex` update. `dropQuality()`/`raiseQuality()` no longer emit — deduplication. Emits only when `fromHeight > 0 && fromHeight != targetHeight && reason.isNotEmpty()`._

_Session 16 — 2026-03-19: 7 bugs fixed from live log analysis. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._
_Bug 1–4 (ABR feedback loop): `EducryptAbrController` — added `tracksInitialized` guard to `onTracksAvailable()` so it only runs once per playback session; extracted named `rampUpRunnable` + `doRampUp()`; `scheduleRampUp()` now calls `removeCallbacks(rampUpRunnable)` before posting to prevent timer accumulation; added `tracksInitialized = false` to `reset()`; added `targetHeight <= 0` guard in `applyQuality()`, `fromHeight <= 0` guard in `dropQuality()` and `raiseQuality()`._
_Bug 5a (non-DRM error silence): `EducryptMedia.initPlayer()` — added `DefaultMediaSourceFactory(context).setLoadErrorHandlingPolicy(EducryptLoadErrorPolicy())` to `ExoPlayer.Builder`. `EducryptLoadErrorPolicy` now active for all media paths (DRM DASH, progressive, non-DRM MediaItem)._
_Bug 5b (RetryAttempted log level): `BaseApp` — raised `Log.d` → `Log.w`; added `event.reason` to log message._
_Bug 6 (DownloadProgressChanged silenced): `BaseApp` — added dedicated `DownloadProgressChanged` branch logging `event.progress` and `event.status`._
_Bug 7a (DownloadDeleted missing event): `EducryptEvent` — added `data class DownloadDeleted(val vdcId: String)`. `EducryptMedia.deleteDownload()` — emits `DownloadDeleted` after `removeDownloads()`._
_Bug 7b (DownloadCancelled/DownloadDeleted silent): `BaseApp` — added dedicated branches for both events at `Log.i`._

_Session 15 — 2026-03-19: Release AAR built and verified. AAR: `EducryptMediaSdk/build/outputs/aar/EducryptMediaSdk-release.aar` (282 KB). consumer-rules.pro verified complete — no missing rules. proguard.txt bundled in AAR with all keep rules. No .kt sources in AAR. classes.jar contains all 11 SDK packages. BUILD SUCCESSFUL._

_Session 14 — 2026-03-19: Event system wired into PlayerActivity and BaseApp._
_PlayerActivity: `events.collect` in `onCreate()` → `showError()` for typed errors, stall progress bar, quality logging. `onPlayerError` raw Toast removed. BaseApp: events.collect upgraded with full per-event type logging (ERROR, RETRY, STALL, SAFE_MODE, QUALITY, BW, DL). Demo app BUILD SUCCESSFUL._

_Session 13 — 2026-03-19: Option A (SDK-Owned Player) implemented. All Phase 3/4 infrastructure now active._
_SDK: `initializeNonDrmDownloadPlayback()` gained `onReady`/`onError` callbacks (fixes async race). Added `getTrackSelector()`, `stop()`, and `EducryptMedia.prepareForPlayback()` companion method._
_App: `PlayerActivity` refactored — removed own `ExoPlayer`/`DefaultTrackSelector`/`DefaultLoadControl`/`initializePlayer()`. All playback via `getPlayer()`. `liveEdgeJob == null` bug fixed. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._

_Session 11 — 2026-03-19: Micro-fix — `initPlayer()` moved from `init {}` to `MediaLoaderBuilder.load()`. Player is now created lazily (only when playback is requested). `getPlayer()` KDoc updated. Both builds SUCCESSFUL._

_Session 10 — 2026-03-19: Phase 4 — ABR + Safe Mode + Phase 3 Carryover Fixes complete._
_Critical fix: `initPlayer()` was never called (dead code since Session 7); added `init {}` block to call it and `getPlayer()` public method._
_Carryover Fix 1 (Case B): ProgressiveMediaSource attachment confirmed correct; no DefaultMediaSourceFactory needed._
_Carryover Fix 2: `abrController?.reset()` added to `setValuesToDefault()`._
_Carryover Fix 3: `EducryptEvent.kt` subtypes regrouped by domain._
_New: `player/EducryptAbrController.kt`. Updated: `EducryptEvent.kt` (+QualityChanged optional fields, +BandwidthEstimated, +SafeModeExited), `EducryptMedia.kt`, `EducryptPlayerListener.kt`._
_Both SDK AAR and demo app BUILD SUCCESSFUL._
_Next: Release validation — ship AAR to test client, monitor Phase 1 logger events._
_
_Session 9 — 2026-03-19: Phase 3 — Buffer Tuning + Stall Recovery + Phase 2 Carryover Fixes complete._
_Carryover Fix 1: `EducryptExoPlayerErrorMapper` — replaced 401/403 message-content heuristics with `HttpDataSource.InvalidResponseCodeException` status code extraction._
_Carryover Fix 2: `EducryptLoadErrorPolicy` attached to `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory` in `initializeNonDrmDownloadPlayback()`. HLS imported but never instantiated — no HLS factory to update._
_Carryover Fix 3: CLAUDE.md updated with dual error emission gotcha._
_New files: `player/EducryptLoadControl.kt` (buffer config), `player/StallRecoveryManager.kt` (stall watchdog)._
_Updated: `logger/EducryptEvent.kt` (+StallDetected, +StallRecovered, +SafeModeEntered), `logger/EducryptPlayerListener.kt` (internal, StallRecoveryManager wired, onPlaybackStateChanged added), `playback/EducryptMedia.kt` (LoadControl + StallRecoveryManager wired in initPlayer)._
_Both SDK AAR and demo app BUILD SUCCESSFUL._
_Next: Phase 4 — ABR + Safe Mode, OR scan EducryptMedia.kt for !! outside initializeDrmPlayback()._

## Current Goal
_Network recovery complete. Release AAR rebuilt. Next: ship to client and monitor `NetworkRestored` + recovery events in production logs._

---

## Decisions Made

### 2026-03-19: !! fix pattern — Category A (in-function assignment)
- **Decision**: Use `checkNotNull(value) { "descriptive message" }` + local val capture for `!!` operators where the value is assigned in the same function just above the use
- **Why**: `checkNotNull` produces a readable `IllegalStateException` instead of a cryptic `KotlinNullPointerException`. Local val capture also prevents the lambda from closing over a mutable `var` (subtle correctness improvement)
- **Impact**: Apply this same pattern to the 3 remaining `!!` in `initializeDrmPlayback()` next session. Classify any new `!!` before fixing — not all will be Category A.

### 2026-03-19: Added POST to retry interceptor
- **Decision**: Added POST to `isRetriableMethod()` in `NetworkManager`
- **Why**: Both SDK POST endpoints (`getVideoDetailsDrm`, `getVideoDetails`) are read-only lookups — retrying them is safe. Without this fix, server 5xx/408/429 responses on `MediaLoaderBuilder.load()` returned immediately without retry.
- **Impact**: If a future POST endpoint is non-idempotent (creates/modifies server state), it must be explicitly excluded from retry at the `isRetriableMethod` call site by URL pattern check.

### 2026-03-19: Fixed consumer-rules.pro
- **Decision**: Added keep rules using `$*` wildcard for inner classes (covers `MediaLoaderBuilder`, `MediaDownloadBuilder`, `Builder` inner classes)
- **Why**: Without `$*`, inner classes (like `EducryptMedia$MediaLoaderBuilder`) get obfuscated even if the outer class is kept
- **Impact**: All public SDK classes are now safe in minified client builds

---

## Decisions Made

### 2026-03-19: Initial Project Audit
- **Decision**: Created project context documentation (CLAUDE.md, TASKS.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md, .claudeignore)
- **Why**: Token optimization and session efficiency for ongoing SDK development
- **Impact**: Build output exclusions from .claudeignore eliminate large generated file noise. Public API surface fully documented to prevent breaking changes.

## Done

### 2026-03-20 (Session 23 — Release AAR build verification)
- ✅ **consumer-rules.pro** — verified complete; all public classes covered including all 25 `EducryptEvent` subtypes via `$*` wildcard
- ✅ **consumerProguardFiles** — confirmed set in `EducryptMediaSdk/build.gradle.kts:15`
- ✅ **proguard.txt inside AAR** — confirmed non-empty; all SDK keep rules bundled
- ✅ **SDK release AAR**: `EducryptMediaSdk/build/outputs/aar/EducryptMediaSdk-release.aar` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL, zero SDK warnings
- ✅ **Demo app**: BUILD SUCCESSFUL against release AAR
- Required client transitive versions: Realm `3.0.0`, Media3 `1.4.1`, WorkManager `2.9.0`

### 2026-03-20 (Session 22 — Download pause/resume bug fix)
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — `pauseDownload()`: after `cancelWorkerForVdcId(vdcId)`, now calls `DownloadProgressManager.getCurrentProgress(vdcId)` and `updateProgress(vdcId, currentProgress.copy(status = DownloadStatus.PAUSED))` — clears stale `DOWNLOADING` entry so `isDownloadActive()` returns false, unblocking resume
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — `pauseDownload()`: `downloadDao.updateStatus(vdcId, "Paused")` → `downloadDao.updateStatus(vdcId, DownloadStatus.PAUSED)` (capital P → constant)
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — `getVideoStatusByVdcId()`: removed redundant `status == "downloaded"` raw string (was `"downloaded" || DownloadStatus.DOWNLOADED`; both identical) → replaced with `status == DownloadStatus.DOWNLOADED`
- ✅ Added import `com.appsquadz.educryptmedia.downloads.DownloadProgress` to `EducryptMedia.kt`
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 14 — Event system: PlayerActivity + BaseApp)
- ✅ **`PlayerActivity.kt`** — added `lifecycleScope.launch { EducryptMedia.events.collect { } }` in `onCreate()`: `ErrorOccurred → showError()`, `StallDetected → progressBar visible`, `StallRecovered → progressBar hidden`, `QualityChanged → Log.d`
- ✅ **`PlayerActivity.showError()`** — typed user-facing messages for all 8 `EducryptError` codes; `isRetrying=true` suppresses Toast; `isFatal=true` uses `LENGTH_LONG`
- ✅ **`PlayerActivity.onPlayerError`** — raw "Playback error. Please try again." Toast removed; handled via `showError()` from events stream
- ✅ **`BaseApp.kt`** — `events.collect` upgraded: SdkError, ErrorOccurred, RetryAttempted, StallDetected, SafeModeEntered, SafeModeExited, QualityChanged, BandwidthEstimated, DownloadCompleted, DownloadFailed each log distinctly; others log via `else` branch
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 13 — Option A: SDK-Owned Player)
- ✅ **`initializeNonDrmDownloadPlayback()`** — added `onReady`/`onError` optional callbacks; backward compatible; `onReady` fires after `mediaSource` is set (fixes async race); `onError` fires if download not found in Realm
- ✅ **`getTrackSelector(): DefaultTrackSelector?`** — new public method; returns SDK-managed selector for `PlayerSettingsBottomSheetDialog`
- ✅ **`stop()`** — new public instance method wrapping `releasePlayer()`; use from `onDestroy()` of player screen
- ✅ **`EducryptMedia.prepareForPlayback()`** — new companion public method; calls `releasePlayer() + initPlayer()`; for offline playback not preceded by `MediaLoaderBuilder.load()`
- ✅ **`PlayerActivity.kt`** — complete refactor: removed own `ExoPlayer`/`DefaultTrackSelector`/`DefaultLoadControl`/`initializePlayer()`; all 3 playback paths (`setPlayer`, `setPlayerNonDrm`, `setPlayerForDownloads`) use `getPlayer()`; `initializeDialog()` uses `getPlayer() + getTrackSelector()`; lifecycle methods use `getPlayer()`; `liveEdgeJob == null` bug fixed (changed to `liveEdgeJob = null`)
- ✅ **Phase 3+4 infrastructure active**: `EducryptLoadControl`, `StallRecoveryManager`, `EducryptAbrController`, `EducryptPlayerListener` all now affect the player that renders to `PlayerView`
- ✅ **`CLAUDE.md`** — player lifecycle gotcha updated; public API surface updated; playback patterns updated for SDK-owned player
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

---

## Done

### 2026-03-19 (Session 10 — Phase 4: ABR + Safe Mode + Phase 3 Carryover Fixes)
- ✅ **Critical fix** — `initPlayer()` was never called; added `init {}` block in `EducryptMedia` constructor to call it; added `getPlayer(): ExoPlayer?` public method
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 1** — Case B confirmed: `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory` attachment is correct for offline encrypted playback; non-DRM online path creates a `MediaItem` only (no factory), so no `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` attachment needed; documented in CLAUDE.md ABR Architecture section
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 2** — `abrController?.reset()` added to `setValuesToDefault()` as the single reset point
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 3** — `EducryptEvent.kt` subtypes regrouped by domain (6 sections with comment headers)
- ✅ **`logger/EducryptEvent.kt`** — `QualityChanged` extended with optional `fromHeight`, `toHeight`, `reason` fields (backward compatible); added `BandwidthEstimated(bandwidthBps)` and `SafeModeExited(stablePlaybackMs)` (total: 22 subtypes)
- ✅ **`player/EducryptAbrController.kt`** (new, internal) — quality ladder, conservative start (mid tier), 15 s bandwidth probe ramp-up, stall → drop one tier, 3 stalls → safe mode, 5 min stable → exit safe mode
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — explicit `DefaultTrackSelector` + `DefaultBandwidthMeter` in `initPlayer()`; `EducryptAbrController` created and wired to `StallRecoveryManager` callbacks; `releasePlayer()` cleans up all 4 components; `setValuesToDefault()` resets all 4 components; `getPlayer()` exposed publicly
- ✅ **`logger/EducryptPlayerListener.kt`** — accepts `EducryptAbrController? = null`; `onTracksChanged` notifies `abrController.onTracksAvailable()`; `onPlaybackStateChanged` STATE_READY notifies `abrController.onStablePlayback()`
- ✅ **`CLAUDE.md`** — ABR Architecture section added; Quick File Finder updated; Gotchas updated
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

---

## Done

### 2026-03-19 (Session 9 — Phase 3: Buffer Tuning + Stall Recovery + Phase 2 Carryover Fixes)
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 1** — `EducryptExoPlayerErrorMapper.kt`: replaced brittle message-content 401/403 heuristics with `HttpDataSource.InvalidResponseCodeException` status code extraction via `extractHttpStatusCode()` cause-chain walk
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 2** — `EducryptMedia.kt`: `EducryptLoadErrorPolicy` attached to `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory` in `initializeNonDrmDownloadPlayback()`; `HlsMediaSource` is imported but never instantiated — no HLS factory update needed
- ✅ **Carryover Fix 3** — `CLAUDE.md`: dual error emission documented in Gotchas (`PlaybackError` + `ErrorOccurred` both emitted per error — DO NOT remove `PlaybackError`)
- ✅ **`logger/EducryptEvent.kt`** — added `StallDetected(positionMs, stallCount)`, `StallRecovered(positionMs, stallDurationMs)`, `SafeModeEntered(reason)` (total: 18 subtypes)
- ✅ **`player/EducryptLoadControl.kt`** (new, internal) — tuned `DefaultLoadControl`: 15s min / 50s max / 3s start / 5s rebuffer; `setPrioritizeTimeOverSizeThresholds(true)`
- ✅ **`player/StallRecoveryManager.kt`** (new, internal) — `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())` watchdog; 8s stall threshold; 3 stalls / 60s → `SafeModeEntered`; `onStallDetected` + `onSafeModeRequired` hooks for Phase 4
- ✅ **`logger/EducryptPlayerListener.kt`** — made `internal`; added `StallRecoveryManager? = null` constructor param; added `onPlaybackStateChanged` for buffering start/end + `StallRecovered` emission
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — `initPlayer()` wires `EducryptLoadControl.build()` + `StallRecoveryManager`; `releasePlayer()` resets and nulls manager; `setValuesToDefault()` calls `stallRecoveryManager?.reset()` on new playback
- ✅ **`CLAUDE.md`** — added buffer tuning + stall thresholds to Gotchas; added player/ + error/ packages to Quick File Finder
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 8 — Phase 2: Error Classification)
- ✅ **`EducryptEvent.kt`** — added `ErrorOccurred(code, message, isFatal, isRetrying)` + `RetryAttempted(attemptNumber, reason, delayMs)` (total: 15 subtypes)
- ✅ **`error/EducryptError.kt`** (new, PUBLIC) — sealed class, 13 subtypes: `SourceUnavailable`, `NetworkTimeout`, `NetworkUnavailable`, `DrmLicenseFailed`, `DrmLicenseExpired`, `DrmNotSupported`, `AuthExpired`, `AuthInvalid`, `UnsupportedFormat`, `DecoderError`, `DownloadFailed`, `StorageInsufficient`, `Unknown`
- ✅ **`error/EducryptExoPlayerErrorMapper.kt`** (new, internal) — maps `PlaybackException` error codes → `EducryptError`; message-content heuristics for 401/403 DRM sub-codes
- ✅ **`error/EducryptLoadErrorPolicy.kt`** (new, internal) — `DefaultLoadErrorHandlingPolicy` subclass; exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s (cap 8s), max 3 retries; emits `RetryAttempted` before each delay; returns `C.TIME_UNSET` after max retries
- ✅ **`logger/EducryptPlayerListener.kt`** — `onPlayerError` now emits both `PlaybackError` (backward compat) and `ErrorOccurred` (classified)
- ✅ **`playback/EducryptMedia.kt`** — `EducryptLoadErrorPolicy` attached to `DashMediaSource.Factory` in `initializeDrmPlayback()`
- ✅ **`consumer-rules.pro`** — added keep rules for `EducryptError` + `EducryptError$*`
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

- ✅ **`EducryptSdkState.kt`** (core/) — `SdkState` enum (UNINITIALISED/READY/SHUT_DOWN) + `AtomicReference` state machine; `transitionTo()` / `reset()` / `isReady()`
- ✅ **`EducryptGuard.kt`** (core/) — `checkReady()` / `checkMainThread()` / `checkString()` / `checkIntRange()` — all emit `SdkError` events, never throw
- ✅ **`EducryptEvent.kt`** — added `SdkError(code, message)` subtype (total: 13 subtypes)
- ✅ **`EducryptEventBus.kt`** — full rewrite: two-layer design (circular `ArrayDeque` buffer MAX=200 under lock + dual `MutableSharedFlow` replay=0 extraBuffer=128 DROP_OLDEST); `AtomicLong` sequence counter; `recentEvents()` / `recentIndexedEvents()` / `clearBuffer()`
- ✅ **`EducryptLifecycleManager.kt`** (lifecycle/) — `ProcessLifecycleOwner` anchor, `AtomicBoolean` init guard, `@Volatile` scope, `SupervisorJob + Dispatchers.Main.immediate`, self-healing collector (`CancellationException` always re-thrown), `onInternalEvent()` hook for Phase 3/4
- ✅ **`EducryptMedia.kt`** — `init()` in companion (enforces applicationContext); `getInstance()` auto-calls `EducryptLifecycleManager.init()` for backward compat; `events`/`indexedEvents`/`recentEvents()`/`recentIndexedEvents()`/`shutdown()` in companion; `logEvent()` guarded; `getPlayerListener()` made internal; `setLogListener()`/`removeLogListener()` removed; `player` field + `initPlayer()`/`releasePlayer()` added; guards on ALL public methods (15+ sites)
- ✅ **`EducryptLogListener.kt`** — deleted
- ✅ **`consumer-rules.pro`** — removed `EducryptLogListener` rule; added `EducryptMedia` public stream methods + `SharedFlow` + `IndexedValue` keep rules
- ✅ **`BaseApp.kt`** — `EducryptMedia.init(this)` + `appScope` + `events.collect {}` with `SdkError` logging
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 6)
- ✅ **EducryptLogger Phase 1** — created `logger/` package with `EducryptEvent` (sealed, 12 subtypes), `EducryptLogListener` (fun interface), `EducryptEventBus` (internal singleton, fire-and-forget), `EducryptPlayerListener` (Player.Listener forwarding buffering/error/quality)
- ✅ **EducryptMedia.kt** — added `setLogListener()`, `removeLogListener()`, `logEvent()`, `getPlayerListener()`; emit hooks: `DrmReady` in `initializeDrmPlayback`, `PlaybackStarted` in `initializeNonDrmPlayback` + `initializeNonDrmDownloadPlayback`, `DownloadStarted`/`Paused`/`Cancelled` in download methods
- ✅ **DownloadProgressManager.kt** — emit `DownloadCompleted`/`DownloadFailed` on status transitions; emit `DownloadProgressChanged` at 25%/50%/75% milestones
- ✅ **consumer-rules.pro** — added 4 keep rules for logger public API (`EducryptEvent`, `EducryptEvent$*`, `EducryptLogListener`, `EducryptPlayerListener`)
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

---

## Up Next

### ⚠️ High Priority (SDK stability)

- [ ] **Scan `EducryptMedia.kt` for `!!` outside `initializeDrmPlayback()`** — `initializeDrmPlayback()` is now clean; rest of the file not yet scanned. Classify any found before fixing.

- [ ] **Fix `downloadableName` API inconsistency** — `DownloadListener.resumeDownload()` accepts `downloadableName` parameter but `EducryptMedia.resumeDownload()` doesn't have it. Either add the param or remove from interface. Breaking change — needs deprecation cycle.

### Medium Priority (SDK quality)

- [ ] **Remove or expose `observeAllDownloads()`** — `EducryptMedia.observeAllDownloads()` is private dead code. Either expose as a public method (additive, non-breaking) or delete it.

- [ ] **SSL/Certificate pinning** — The `createCertificatePinner()` method and `if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG)` block are fully implemented but commented out in `NetworkManager`. Enable for production builds with real certificate hashes.

- [ ] **Review Realm `api()` dependency** — Realm is exposed as a transitive dependency to AAR consumers. Consider if this is intentional (clients can use Realm models directly) or if it should be `implementation`.

### Low Priority (Demo App)

- [ ] **Fix `liveEdgeJob == null` bug** — `PlayerActivity.onDestroy()` line 334: comparison `==` instead of assignment `=`. Dead code — job is never nulled out. Demo-only, but misleading.

- [ ] **Clean up commented-out credentials in Const.kt** — Two alternate credential sets are commented out. Remove or document what they were for.

- [ ] **Demo supports only 1 download at a time** — `SharedPreference.instance.getDownloadData()` stores a single `ListItem`. Multiple concurrent downloads are supported by the SDK but the demo UI only shows one. Consider updating demo to use `DownloadProgressManager.allDownloadsLiveData`.

## Done

### 2026-03-19 (Session 5)
- ✅ **EducryptMedia.kt** — replaced `dataSourceFactory!!` (×2) with single `localDataSourceFactory` via `checkNotNull()`; replaced `drmCallback!!` with `localDrmCallback` via `checkNotNull()`. `initializeDrmPlayback()` now has 0 `!!` operators.
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 4)
- ✅ **EducryptMedia.kt** — replaced `drmSessionManager!!` and `mediaItem!!` in `initializeDrmPlayback()` with `checkNotNull()` + descriptive `IllegalStateException` messages; captured into local vals so lambda no longer closes over mutable var
- ✅ SDK AAR: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- ✅ Demo app: BUILD SUCCESSFUL

### 2026-03-19 (Session 3)
- ✅ **NetworkManager.kt** — added POST to `isRetriableMethod()`; verified both POST endpoints are idempotent read-only lookups
